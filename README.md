  Scans the most critical/common ports (like 80, 443, 22, etc.) and identifies running services.

- **Subdomain Discovery:**  
  Uses [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) to find subdomains registered in public certificate transparency logs.

  Automatically checks if each subdomain is live over HTTP and HTTPS.
